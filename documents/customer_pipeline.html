      <p class="subtitle">
        Step-by-step journey of a customer applying for a loan
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1: Loan Application</h2>
      <p>
        The customer fills out a loan application using a web or mobile app.
        Details include personal information, income, employment, bank account,
        and required KYC documents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Data Verification</h2>
      <p>
        The system validates the submitted details, checks for missing or incorrect
        information, and verifies identity using KYC services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Credit & Financial Check</h2>
      <p>
        Credit score and financial history are fetched from credit bureaus and
        bank statements to understand the repayment capability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4: Eligibility Check</h2>
      <p>
        Basic eligibility rules such as age, income threshold, and employment
        criteria are applied. Ineligible applications are rejected instantly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 5: Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        A machine learning model evaluates the risk and predicts the probability
        of default based on the customer's financial profile.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 6: Loan Decision</h2>
      <p>
        The system automatically approves or rejects the loan. In rare cases,
        the application may be sent for manual review.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 7: Loan Offer</h2>
      <p>
        If approved, the customer receives a loan offer with amount, interest rate,
        tenure, and EMI details. The customer can accept digitally.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 8: Disbursement</h2>
      <p>
        After acceptance, the loan amount is transferred directly to the
        customer’s bank account.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 9: Repayment & Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        The customer repays EMIs as scheduled. The system continuously monitors
        payments and sends reminders if required.
